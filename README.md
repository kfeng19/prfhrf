This repository contains the source code for the AA222 (Spring 2020) project: "Co-estimation of Population Receptive Field (pRF) and Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)"

Here an interior point methods with BFGS is used to optimize a L2 loss. A better approach may be utilizing L-M method with random initializations.
